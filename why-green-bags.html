            <h3>A Non Woven Bag is the Paramount Alternative to Plastic Bags for Daily Use</h3>
            <p><img src="images/eco-friendly.jpg" alt="ECO Bags" width="160" align="left" style="margin-right:15px;" />It is common  knowledge that plastic bags are among the widespread pollutants in landfills  and our surroundings in general. Unfortunately, these solid waste materials are  one of the main reasons for the clogging of drains and the pollution of oceans.  It even leads to the deaths of marine animals like sea turtles that mistake the  floating plastic for jellyfish, ingest the refuse and sadly, perish. Due to  this situation, bag manufacturers with a green conscience are constantly  marketing a superior alternative to plastic and paper bags &ndash; the&nbsp;non woven bag. An  increasing number of consumers as well as many industries around the world are  using this high quality option today.</p>
            <p>A non woven bag is made of spun bond non woven polypropylene (PP) cloth which  is 100% recyclable. It decomposes without problems and burns completely without  toxic contaminants. Notably, PVC coating and water is absent in manufacturing  this synthetic compound compared to making paper which uses much water. These  facts make this bag the better alternative to plastic or paper bags for daily  use. Although paper can be recycled, the non woven carriers are more durable  which assures less breakage. People must take into consideration that paper can  be recycled until around three times because its fibers tend to be reduced  significantly, which is important in maintaining its strength.</p>
            <p>In a society that is driven by consumerism, it is essential to introduce green  products to replace merchandise like plastic that are detrimental to the  environment. Reusable and recyclable woven bags are also popular but its non  woven counterpart is more preferred because almost all recycling facilities  accept them. Nowadays, there is a higher production rate in the manufacturing  of a non woven bag compared to its eco friendly counterparts. Furthermore,  manufacturers create stylish designs and colors as well as offer services in  screen printing and heat transfer full color printing to their buyers. The  attractiveness of a non woven bag makes it more competitively priced on the  market.</p>
            <p>Aside from shopping and carrying various items, the reusable bag is also  utilized by its patrons as a gift bag or a party giveaway. The individuals and  industries appreciate the advantages of using it for their daily or special  activities due to its strength, lightweight, softness and packable quality.  Moreover, a non woven bag is liquid repellant, allows air circulation and is  washable. Businesses like groceries, department stores and those in retail are  just some of the frequent users of the non woven carriers. Those in the  hospitality or food and beverage industry are also using the bag for their  special goods like wine. Corporate companies make use of it as a promotional  medium in their events. These real life examples just go to show that the  product is a versatile and practical item. Without a doubt, people can  gradually eradicate plastic bags on the market by shifting to an eco friendly  alternative. Using a non woven carrier promotes an environment friendly way of  living and an effective means of achieving a better, cleaner society.            </p>
